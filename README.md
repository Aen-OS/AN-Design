## Next Steps (for me!):

### TODO:

- insert calendly link in sticky-banner top of page.
- make front hero responsive (including h1 and h2)
- link social media icons in footer
- add templates and projecs for show (each must have their own pages for in-depth presentation - templates can all be on one page with user to browser through)
- add google analytics

### POLICY:

- Research why websites have cookies and privacy policy.
- make cookie banner for users to accept.
- make cookies and privacy policy page for users to read.

### SERVICES:

- web design
- web development (i adapt to the needs of the client but I work with jamstack, wordpress, webflow/framer, so whether you need a simple website (jamstack) with a couple of pages to inform people about your business or something else more complex consisting of a lot of functionality and features, we can build it together.)
- SEO (do a course and learn the basics - apply it to website and other projects)
- Branding (learn the process, apply it to self and projects) (this probably includes logo design)

### BLOG:

- write first blog about having built first portfolio website, and starting your web dev freelance journey
- write second blog on listing all resources you know regarding web dev and web design.

### PHASE 2:

- TRANSFER FROM NEXTJS TO ASTRO, WRITE BLOGS IN MARKDOWN
- include services page?
